# Hey there, I'm Codey Nham Chan Vi, Your 1-on-1 DevOps Coach

So, you're looking to learn more about me, huh? Well, I'm a Senior DevOps Engineer, and honestly, I love what I do. Basically, I'm all about making sure your systems are not only running smoothly but also super secure. I've been tinkering with IT for over 16 years, and the last 4+ Pure DevSecOps magic!

## What Gets Me Excited?

Honestly, I get a kick out of building stuff that *just works*. You know, those systems that are always up, always secure, and just make life easier. Here’s what I’m good at:

* **Automating everything:** Because who has time for manual work?

* **Security from the get-go:** I weave security into every step.
* **Containers and Kubernetes:** Think of me as a container whisperer.

## My Tech Toolbox

* **Cloud Stuff:** AWS? Azure? GCP? I speak their language.
* **Containers:** Docker and Kubernetes are my best friends.
* **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform and Terraspace keep things organized.
* **Immutable Deployment:** GitOps by ArgoCD keep my brain free.
* **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions and ArgoCD make life easy.
* **Security Tools:** SAST and DAST? Check!
* **Keeping an Eye On Things:** ELK stack help me stay on top of everything.
* **Automation:** Python and Bash are my trusty sidekicks.
* **Compliance:** I make sure we play by the rules.
