# Hey there, I'm Codey Nham Chan Vi, your 1-on-1 DevOps Coach.

So, you're looking to learn more about me. Well, I'm a Senior Dev(Sec)Ops Engineer, and honestly, I love what I do. Basically, I'm all about making sure your systems are not only running smoothly but also super secure. I've been tinkering with IT for over 16 years, and the last 4+ years have been full of Pure DevSecOps magic!

## What Gets Me Excited?

Honestly, I get a kick out of building stuff that _just works_. You know, those systems are always up and secure and just make life easier. Here’s what I’m good at:

- **Automating almost everything:** Because who has time for manual work? But need to decide what to automate and what not to automate.
- **Making deployments a breeze:** CI/CD pipelines? That's my jam.
- **Security from the get-go:** I weave security into every step; GitOps helps me most.
- **Containers and Kubernetes:** Think of me as a container whisperer.
- **Configuration Management:** I love monolith.

## My Tech Toolbox

- **Cloud Stuff:** I speak the AWS language now and am learning to speak Azure and GCP.
- **Containers:** Docker and Kubernetes are my best friends.
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform and Terraspace keep things organized.
- **Immutable Deployment:** GitOps by ArgoCD keeps my brain free.
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions and ArgoCD make life easy.
- **Security Tools:** SAST and DAST? Check!
- **Keeping an Eye On Things:** The ELK stack helps me stay on top of everything.
- **Automation:** Python, Bash, Ansible, and Packer are my trusty sidekicks.
- **Compliance:** I make sure we play by the rules.
