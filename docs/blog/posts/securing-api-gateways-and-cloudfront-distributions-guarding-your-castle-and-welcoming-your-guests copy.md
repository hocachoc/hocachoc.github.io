"Linux Treasure Hunt": Hide a "treasure" (a file with a secret message) somewhere in your file system, then write a shell script using find and other commands to locate it. This is a fun way to learn about file system navigation and command-line tools.
"The System Sleuth": Use commands like top, free, and df to investigate your system's resource usage. Track CPU usage, memory consumption, and disk space over time. This will give you insights into how your system works and how to monitor its health.
"The Backup Master": Write a script that automatically backs up your important files and directories. You can use tools like rsync or tar to create archives and store them in a safe location. This is a practical project that teaches you about data protection and automation.
"The Log File Whisperer": Explore your system's log files (e.g., /var/log/syslog) using commands like grep, tail, and less. Learn to filter and analyze log data to understand what's happening on your system. This is a valuable skill for troubleshooting and system administration.
